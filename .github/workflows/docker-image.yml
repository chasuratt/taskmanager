# Name of the workflow - this will appear in your GitHub Actions tab
name: Docker CI/CD Pipeline

# Define when this workflow should run

  push:
    branches: [ main ]  # Runs when code is pushed to the main branch

    branches: [ main ]  # Also runs when PRs are created against main

# A workflow consists of one or more jobs that run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  build-and-push:
    # This job will run on a GitHub-hosted runner with Ubuntu
